### Research Experiences

I have completed my PhD in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto in Nov 2025. My research training during my PhD at Dr. Thomas Kislinger's lab focused on optimizing large-scale proteomics analysis for prostate cancer patients, and unveiling heterogeneity of urine proteome driven by ancestry-related factors. Prior to my PhD, I was under Dr. Hannes Rost's supervision where I contributed to optimization of python packages and proteomics workflows for novel mass spectrometry-based methods. The details of my training are listed in this portfolio page.
