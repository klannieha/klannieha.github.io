## Ion Mobillity DIA Tool-Kit **(MOBI-DIK)**

MOBI-DIK is a workflow for analyzing data-independent acquisition-coupled parallel accumulation and serial fragmentation **(diaPASEF)** data. MOBI-DIK is an extension of the OpenSWATH workflow that is optimized for ion mobility analysis as well as _diapysef_, a _python_ package converting diaPASEF data from vendor format to open mzML format.

### 1. Optimization of high dimensional data acquisition with timsTOF

### 2. Streamline library generation for ion mobility

### 3. Application on varying injection amount
