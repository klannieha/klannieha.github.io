## Evaluation and Optimization of Data-Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry for Prostate Cancer Urine Proteomics Analysis

Biofluids such as urine contain molecules in circulation and from nearby organs that can be indicative of disease states. However, comprehensive profiling of the proteomes in urine has been challening due to high dynamic range and variability between samples. Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) has been popularized over recent decades as a high throughput and sensitive bottom-up proteomics workflow with improved data completeness compared to conventional MS methods. Hence, characteirizing the proteome of patient-derived urines with DIA-MS is an emerging area of interest for biomarker discovery. Thus far, there is limited consensus on DIA-MS acquisition and analysis approaches. In this project, I benchmarked several published DIA-MS acquisition schemes, as well as various computational analysis workflows using a clinically heterogeneous cohort from patients with localized prostate cancer, to identify an optimal DIA-MS workflow for large-scale urine proteomics analyses.


### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
